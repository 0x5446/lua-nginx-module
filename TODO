Current:
* deal with TCP 3-second delay problem under great connection harness

Future:
* add 'lua_require' directive to load module into main thread's globals
* add trace-back message in Lua runtime error
* add Lua VM passive yield and resume (using debug hook)
* make set_by_lua using the same mechanism as content_by_lua
