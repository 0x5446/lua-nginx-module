Problems:
	* can't access $request_body in content_by_lua
	* package globals occasional missing in content_by_lua

Current:
	* add ngx.log(level, ...) to output contents to nginx error log, 'level' could be one of ngx.LOG_INFO/ngx.LOG_WARN/ngx.LOG_ERR
	* include original path/cpath instead of override them all for lua_package_path/cpath
	* add directives to run lua codes when nginx stops/reloads
	* implement ngx.exec() functionality
	* deal with TCP 3-second delay problem under great connection harness

Future:
	* add 'lua_require' directive to load module into main thread's globals
	* add Lua VM passive yield and resume (using debug hook)
	* make set_by_lua using the same mechanism as content_by_lua
